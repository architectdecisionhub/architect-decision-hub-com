# 🏛️ Architect Decision Hub (ADH) Official GitHub Organization

## 🚀 Mission Statement

**ArchitectDecisionHub.com** is the definitive resource for senior cloud practitioners making high-stakes, multi-cloud architecture and financial decisions.

We move beyond mere "how-to" guides to focus on **The Why, The When, and The Trade-offs.**

## 💡 Our Core Focus: Quantifying Architecture Decisions

This repository hosts essential code and templates that embody our core values:

* **FinOps Excellence:** Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) designed for quantifiable cost optimization and financial governance.
* **Trade-off Analysis:** Code samples demonstrating the architectural impact of choosing speed vs. security vs. cost.
* **Multi-Cloud Agnosticism:** Templates and solutions designed to be adaptable across AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.
